ecdata
======

This is a repository of the data files containing the Cremona Database of all elliptic curves over Q of bounded conductor. 

These files provide the source data for the elliptic curve pages at http://www.lmfdb.org . 

The current release is published as http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.161341

For a description of how most of the data here was computed, see the ANTS 7 Procedings at 
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/ants/proceedings.html .  
For a description of the algorithms used, see the book Algorithms for Modular Elliptic Curves, published by CUP in 1992 
(second edition 1997) and available online here:
