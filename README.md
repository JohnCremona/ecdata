This is a repository of the data files containing the Cremona Database of all elliptic curves over Q of bounded conductor. These files are behind the web pages at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/ .  For a description of how most of the data here was computed, see the ANTS 7 Proeedings at http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/ants/proceedings.html .  For a description of the algorithms used, see the book Algorithms for Modular Elliptic Curves, published by CUP in 1992 (second edition 1997) and available online here: http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/book/fulltext/
