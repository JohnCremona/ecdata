The files in this directory were updated in November 2001.  

   The tables are extended to level (conductor) 12000.

   For levels up to 8000 fuller data exists, including determination
   of the optimal curve in each isogeny class and the degree of the
   modular parametrization.  The numbering of the curves in each class
   (with the optimal curve #1, except for class 990H) may be taken as
   canonical and standard in this range.

   For levels 8001-12000 we give all curves in each isogeny class, but
   the first curve is not known to be optimal (unless the class only
   contains one curve, of course).  The numbering of the curves in
   each class containing more than one curve should NOT be taken as
   canonical and standard: it will change if the optimal curve turns
   out to be not the currently labelled first curve.  It is likely
   (based on past observation) that, where the first curve in a class
   is not optimal, it is related to the optimal curve by a 2-isogeny.

   In the range 8001-12000 we also do not have the modular degree (in
   most cases).

   For any individual level in the range 8001-12000, it is possible to
   carry out the extra computations needed to fill these gaps
   (determining the optimal curve and modular degree), but doing so
   for all curves in the range would probably take a few months with
   the current algorithms and programs.  An independent computation by
   Mark Watkins <watkins@math.psu.edu> has determined, conditionally
   on the Stevens conjecture, which curve in each class is optimal,
   and has determined its modular degree.  Our results agree for all
   levels up to 8000 and we expect them to agree in the higher range
   also.

   The computations are likely to continue above level 12000 at some time.

Error corrected 17/9/01: Added 5104B1 to files, omitted due to an error
discovered while working on 2*5104=10208.  Checking has shown that no
further omissions were made at around the same time.

Update 12/12/01: for around 10% of classes in the range 8201-9000 the
ordering has been changed.  In the new order the first curve in each
class is more likely (though not guaranteed) to be optimal.  This
change makes this range compatible with the range 9001-12000 in that
the same strategy is used throughout for finding a curve from each
newform.
