The files in this directory were updated in March/April 2001.  

   The tables are extended from level (conductor) 6000 to 10000.

   For levels up to 7000 fuller data exists, including determination
   of the optimal curve in each isogeny class and the degree of the
   modular parametrization.  The numbering of the curves in each class
   (with the optimal curve #1, except for class 990H) may be taken as
   canonical and standard in this range.

   For levels 7001-10000 we give all curves in each isogeny class, but
   the first curve is not known to be optimal (unless the class only
   contains one curve, of course).  The numbering of the curves in
   each class containing more than one curve should NOT be taken as
   canonical and standard: it will change if the optimal curve turns
   out to be not the currently labelled first curve.  It is likely
   (based on past observation) that, where the first curve in a class
   is not optimal, it is related to the optimal curve by a 2-isogeny.

   In this range we also do not have the modular degree (in most
   cases).

   For any individual level in this range it is possible to carry out
   the extra computations needed to fill these gaps (determining the
   optimal curve and modular degree), but doing so for all curves in
   the range would take several months with the current algorithms and
   programs.
