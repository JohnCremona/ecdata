The files in this directory were updated in September 1998.  

The main changes are

1. (February 1998) 

15 extra newforms and 16 curves were added at levels 3371, 4009, 4021,
4051, 4195, 4279, 4339, 4451, 4495 (1 extra newform, 2 isogenous
curves), 4499, 4595, 4631 (2 extra newforms), 4799, 4961.  These were
omitted in error earlier, apparently because of a bug in the sparse
linear algebra procedures I was using.  This was discovered in
November 1997 by R. Schulze-Pillot, who determined the existence of a
curve of conductor 4799 whic was not in my earlier table.  As a
result, I recomputed the number of newforms for every level up to 5077,
finding 15 more.

As a result, some of the numbers of curves as listed in the 2nd
edition of the Book need adjusting, as follows:

N		all	r=0	r=1	r=2	r=3

3001-4000	*3837*	*1665*	(2006)	(166)	(0)
4001-5000	*3962*	*1690*	*2092*	*180*	(0)

   1-5077	*17598*	*8095*	*8959*	*603*	(1)

where *...* denotes a corrected number.

2. The extra computations required to both determine the "strong"
curve in each class and also compute the degree of the modular
parametrization deg(phi) have now been completed to conductor 5300.
At this point I have generators for all the strong curves only.

3. The modular degrees for N=912 were wrong, here and in the book (2nd
   edition);  now corrected.

4. Partial data from 5300 to 5500 is now here.  This should be
   completed to level 6000 shortly.
