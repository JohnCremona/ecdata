Format of elliptic curve database files

Each file consists of lines, one per curve, with certain data fields
on each line, separated by whitespace.  The names of these data fields
used here are not standard except for "Cremona label" and "LMFDB
label", and are defined here for local reference only.

Data fields (and metafields combining several fields):

N:           Conductor

CLASSCODE: Letter code of isogeny class (a, b, ..., z, ba, bb, ...)
           in the Cremona labelling scheme (for many ranges this was
           not deterministic and is only defined by the data files
           here).

NCURVE: Number of the curve in its isogeny class (1,2,...)

LMFDB_CLASSCODE: Letter code of isogeny class (a, b, ..., z, ba, bb,
            ...)  in the LMFDB numbering.  This is by lexicographical
            ordering of the vectors of AP over all primes, good and
            bad, i.e. by lexicographical order of the integral
            coefficients of the L-functions as a Dirichlet series.

LMFDB_NCURVE: Number of the curve in its isogeny class (1,2,...) in
             the LMFDB numbering.  This is by lexicographical ordering
             of the vector [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] of the reduced Weierstrass
             coefficients; since a1,a2,a3 are the same in any class
             this is also the lexicographical order of [a4,a6].

ID: Concatenation of (N,CLASSCODE,NCURVE) separated by whitespace,
    e.g. 11 a 1

IDX: Concatenation of (N,CLASSCODE,NCURVE) with no whitespace,
    e.g. 11a1

CREMONA_LABEL: Concatenation of (N,CLASSCODE,NCURVE) with no
            whitespace separation, e.g. 11a1. This is called the
            "Cremona label" of the elliptic curve.

LMFDB_LABEL: Concatenation of (N,".",CLASSCODE,NCURVE) with no
            whitespace separation) e.g. 11.a1. This is called the
            "LMFDB label" of the elliptic curve.  It differs from the
            Cremona label in the insertion of the "." after the
            conductor, as well as the possibly different isogeny class
            code and curve number.

NNF:         Number of newforms / isogeny classes (for a fixed
             N). Non-negative integer.

AI:          Reduced minimial Weierstrass coefficients
                in format [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] (integers, no spaces; a1,a3
                are in {0,1} and a2 is in {-1,0,1}).
R:           Rank.  Non-negative integer.
T:           Torsion order. Positive integers.

                integers>1 and n1 dividing n2.
TGENS:       Torsion generators: 0, 1 or 2 points in format [x:y:z]
                with x, y, z coprime integers, no embedded space              
GENS:        Generators of infinite order:
              R points in formst [x:y:z] separated by whitespace
AGENS:       Generators of infinite order as a list of [x,y] with x, y
                rationals, no embedded space.

AP:             a2 a3 a5 a7 a11 (etc.) where each ap is the p'th
                eigenvalue of the newform (integers, separated by
                whitespace).  When p divides N this is the W_p
                eigenvalue, shown just as "+" or "-"; else the T_p
                eigenvalue.  

AP25:            AP for all primes<100 (the first 25 primes).

BQ:             If there are primes q>100 dividing N this string is
                either +(q) or -(q) showing the eigenvalue of W_q and
                the value of q; or two such strings separated by
                whitespace, if there is more than one such prime
                (e.g. N=50038, q=127 and q=197).  Else empty.

CP:         Product of Tamagawa numbers.  Positive integer.
OM          Real period.  Real number.
L1:          L(r)(E,1)/r!.  Real number.
REG:         Regulator. Real number.
SHA:         Analytic order of Sha.  Either positive integer, or Real number.
DEG:         Degree of modular parametrization.  Positive integer.
PDEG:        Set of primes dividing DEG. e.g.  {p,q} with p, q primes.
CLASS:       [E1,E2,...,En] where n=#isogeny class, Ei=AI for i'th
             curve.  No embedded space.
ISOGMAT:     Matrix of isogeny degrees between Ei and Ej, as a list of
            lists with no spaces.  e.g. [[1,5,5],[5,1,25],[5,25,1]].
XLIST:       List of x-coordinates of integral points (integers, no spaces).

GAL_IM:      Sutherland code for (non-surjective) Galois image
             (string, starting with a prime, e.g. 5Cs.1.1)
GAL_IMS:     Sequence of 0 or more GAL_IM separated by whitespace

2IND:        Index of image of 2-adic representation in GL_2,Z_2).

             integers, no embedded space.
